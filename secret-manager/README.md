# Quarkus - Google Cloud Services - Secret Manager

This extension allows to use the Google Cloud Platform Secret Manager client library inside your Quarkus application. The current implementation is focused on _accessing_ the secrets, but extending the implementation into also allowing to create or edit a secret might be a natural next step.

It also allows to use secrets from the secret manager directly inside your `application.properties`.

You can find the documentation in the [Secret Manager Quarkiverse documentation site](https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-google-cloud-services/main/secretmanager.html).
